# Picnic MCP — Home Assistant add-on

Let AI assistants use your **[Picnic](https://picnic.app)** grocery account
from your own Home Assistant, over the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Ask Claude
*"plan vijf avondmaaltijden voor twee en zet de boodschappen in mijn
mandje"* or *"wanneer komt mijn bezorging?"* on your phone, laptop or the
web, and it searches products and recipes, fills your cart and checks your
deliveries. You still check out in the Picnic app yourself.

> **Powered by [mcp-picnic](https://github.com/ivo-toby/mcp-picnic) by Ivo
> Toby.** The Picnic tools — the hard part — are theirs. This add-on packages
> them for Home Assistant and adds authentication, OAuth for the Claude apps,
> a 2FA flow and tool permissions. It is an independent project, **not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the mcp-picnic authors or Picnic**.

## What this add-on adds

- **Authentication.** A bearer token on every MCP request, generated on first
  start, plus an OAuth 2.1 layer (dynamic client registration + PKCE) so
  Claude on the web, desktop, iOS and Android can connect with no header
  field.
- **Permissions.** Browsing products, recipes, the cart and deliveries is
  always available. Changing the cart is on by default; changing deliveries
  and reading account or payment details are off until you turn them on.
- **2FA and login status** in a small web UI inside Home Assistant, instead of
  a crash loop when a password is wrong.

## Install

> [!NOTE]
> HACS can't install this — it's a Supervisor add-on, so it comes from the
> **Add-on Store**.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FEmacee%2FPicnic-MCP-Home-Assistant-app)

1. Click the button, or go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ →
   Repositories** and add `https://github.com/Emacee/Picnic-MCP-Home-Assistant-app`.
2. Install **Picnic MCP**, fill in your Picnic e-mail, password and country
   on the **Configuration** tab, and start it.
3. Open the add-on's web UI. If your account uses 2FA, request a code there
   and enter it.

Requires a 64-bit Home Assistant OS or Supervised install (`amd64` or `aarch64`).

## Reaching it from your devices

On your own network the MCP endpoint is `http://<HA host>:8097/mcp`.

To use it from your phone or claude.ai, give it **its own subdomain** through
a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://github.com/homeassistant-apps/app-cloudflared)
(or any reverse proxy):

```
https://picnic.example.com/mcp  ──►  http://<HA host>:8097/mcp
```

1. Add a public hostname `picnic.example.com` to your tunnel with service
   `http://<HA host>:8097`. Cloudflare creates the DNS record.
2. Set `mcp_url` in this add-on to `https://picnic.example.com/mcp` and
   restart it.
3. In Claude: **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** →
   `https://picnic.example.com/mcp`, and paste the add-on's token on the page
   that opens. The connector then works in the Claude apps on all your
   devices.

Running other MCP add-ons, such as
[Dutch Open Data MCP](https://github.com/Emacee/Dutch-Open-Data-MCP---Home-Assistant-App)?
Give each its own subdomain the same way; they stay fully independent. The
Documentation tab has the details.

## Security, briefly

This add-on can change what gets delivered to your door. Keep the generated
token (it is the only lock), leave the delivery and account groups off unless
you need them, and read the *Security* section of the documentation before
exposing it to the internet. Your Picnic password and the session live only
in the add-on's own storage on your Home Assistant; nothing is committed to
this repository or sent anywhere but Picnic.
